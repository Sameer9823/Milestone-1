# Milestone-1
HTML/CSS/TAILWINDCSS PROJECT

This project showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that has revolutionized the way I design and style web applications.

In this repository, you'll find a complete set of files that make up a sleek and responsive web page. The HTML files structure the content, while the CSS and Tailwind CSS stylesheets bring life to the design. I've harnessed the power of Tailwind's utility classes to craft a stunning visual experience without writing extensive custom CSS.
